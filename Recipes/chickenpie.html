        <h2>What is a Chicken Pie?</h2>
        <p>A delicious chicken pie made from scratch with carrots, peas, and celery in a pre-made crust. Add thyme and poultry seasoning for more flavor.</p>
        <h3>The ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Chicken:</strong> Boneless, skinless chicken breasts (cut into cubes) are ideal for making classic chicken pot pie. </li>
            <li><strong>Vegetables:</strong> This chicken pot pie recipe calls for the usual suspects: peas, carrots, onions, and celery. You could toss in some mushrooms or green peppers if you want to incorporate more veggies.</li>
            <li><strong>Butter and Flour:</strong> The chicken pot pie filling starts with a roux made with butter and all-purpose flour. </li>
            <li><strong>Seasonings:</strong> Achieve the perfect cozy flavor with salt, pepper, and celery seed. Of course, you can add more seasonings to suit your taste. </li>
            <li><strong>Broth and Milk:</strong> Chicken broth and milk add depth of flavor and help create a smooth and decadent chicken pot pie filling consistency. </li>
            <li><strong>Pie Crusts:</strong> You'll need two unbaked pie crusts. If you opt for the homemade route, you can't go wrong with our Butter Flaky Pie Crust recipe â€” but store-bought is perfectly fine. </li>
        </ul>
